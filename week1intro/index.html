<h1>Helllloooooo Class!</h1>
<p>It's me, Donnie G.!!</p>
<hr>
<p> I first became interested in computers through the Minecraft modding community (haha) when I was young!
<br> Most of the sites I used as a kid allowed their users to have highly customized profie pages (Tumblr, LiveJournal, etc.)
<br> and that's where the concept of web design was introduced to me. </p>

<p> While I have an understanding of the basics of html, I've always been a bit intimidated by CSS. 
	<br> I'm looking forward to furthering my knowledge of both technologies and fixing any html bad habits I may have picked up along the way.
	<br> In terms of the future.....?
	<br> I'd like to transfer to a 4 year school and continue my studies into either programming or cybercrime (scrubbing hard drives, following trails, CSI stuff).
</p>

<p> In a beautiful, perfect world, I would be a DJ. I've never tried to so much as match a beat,<br>but one day DJ Wet Sneeze will take over the world >:)
<br>
	More realistically, I just want to do <i>something</i> with computers and find a way to have even a little bit of fun in my career. 
</p>

<p> I don't have any pictures of myself on hand, so please enjoy this Creative Commons ant. </p>
