<h3 style="color:MediumVioletRed; font-size: 26px;"> Who Are We? </h3> <hr>
<p style="line-height:2;"> 	Beanie Beaches is a project run by a small, committed team of long-time Beanie Baby collectors.
<br>What started as a way to trade Beanies and manage our collections has blossomed into a community of buyers and sellers, 
<br> ran by and for Beanie fans. Beanie Beaches works as a middle man for Beanie Bids, facilitating the purchasing 
<br> and shipment of Beanies around the world. Like Ebay...but cuddlier!
